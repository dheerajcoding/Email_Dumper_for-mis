# 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide - No Data Showing

## ❌ Problem Identified

Your sync was running but **0 records were being created** in the database.

### Root Cause:
1. **Async timing issue**: Files were being downloaded but the async operations weren't completing before the controller tried to process them
2. **Files deleted prematurely**: Files were being deleted before they could be read
3. **Same emails processed multiple times**: Emails were being marked as read AFTER processing instead of ONLY after successful processing

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed IMAP Email Fetching
- Changed from `setTimeout` to proper `Promise.all()` to wait for all emails to be parsed
- Added proper async/await handling for attachment downloads
- Added file verification before processing

### 2. Fixed File Handling
- Files are now verified to exist after download
- Files are only deleted AFTER successful processing
- Added detailed logging to track file operations

### 3. Fixed Sync Logic  
- Emails are only marked as "Read" AFTER files are successfully downloaded
- Added error logging with full stack traces
- Added file existence checks before processing

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Method 1: Test Sync Manually (Recommended)

Run this command to test the sync:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\int0003\desktop\new folder\Email_Dumper_for-mis\backend"
node -e "require('dotenv').config(); const syncController = require('./controllers/syncController'); syncController.triggerSync({ }, { json: console.log, status: () => ({ json: console.log }) });"
```

### Method 2: Test via API

1. Make sure backend is running on `http://localhost:5000`
2. Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:5000/api/sync/refresh" -Method POST | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Content
```

### Method 3: Test via Dashboard

1. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
2. Click the **"Sync Now"** button
3. Wait for the sync to complete (watch the backend console for logs)
4. Refresh the page to see imported data

## 📊 What to Look For

### Backend Console Output (Good):
```
Connecting to email server...
IMAP connection ready
Opening mailbox...
Searching for unread emails...
Found 62 unread emails from ABHICL.MIS@adityabirlahealth.com
Processing first 20 emails (42 remaining)
Fetching email details...
Processing email: [Subject]
✅ Saved and verified: filename.xlsx
Total files downloaded: X
Extracted Y records from filename.xlsx
✅ Created: X, Updated: Y, Unchanged: Z
```

### Backend Console Output (Bad):
```
❌ File not found: path/to/file.xlsx
Error processing filename.xlsx: ENOENT: no such file or directory
```

## 🔍 Checking if Data Was Imported

Run this command to check the database:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\int0003\desktop\new folder\Email_Dumper_for-mis\backend"
node test-db-connection.js
```

You should see:
```
Current documents in collection: [NUMBER > 0]
```

If it still shows 0, check the backend logs for errors.

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Files Not Being Saved
**Symptom**: "File not found after download"
**Solution**: 
- Check uploads folder permissions
- Verify the path in `.env`: `UPLOAD_FOLDER=./uploads`
- Ensure the uploads folder exists

### Issue 2: Excel Parsing Errors  
**Symptom**: "Error parsing Excel file" or "PROPOSAL NUMBER field is missing"
**Solution**:
- Check that Excel files have the correct column headers
- Verify "PROPOSAL NUMBER" column exists and has data
- Check for special characters in column names

### Issue 3: No Emails Being Fetched
**Symptom**: "Found 0 unread emails"
**Solution**:
- Verify emails are from `ABHICL.MIS@adityabirlahealth.com`
- Check that emails are marked as "Unread"
- Verify email credentials in `.env`

### Issue 4: Database Connection Failed
**Symptom**: "Error connecting to MongoDB"
**Solution**:
- Check internet connection
- Verify `MONGO_URI` in `.env`
- Check MongoDB Atlas is accessible

## 📝 Manual Sync Test Script

Created a test script at: `backend/manual-sync-test.js`

Run it with:
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\int0003\desktop\new folder\Email_Dumper_for-mis\backend"
node manual-sync-test.js
```

This will:
1. Connect to email
2. Fetch first email with Excel attachment
3. Download and save the file
4. Extract and import data to database
5. Show detailed results

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [ ] Frontend server running on port 3000
- [ ] MongoDB connection successful
- [ ] Email filter working (only ABHICL.MIS emails)
- [ ] Files being saved to uploads folder
- [ ] Data being imported to database
